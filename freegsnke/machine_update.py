        Parameters
        ----------

            Dictionary containing the active coil description.

            List of limiter boundary points.
        wall_data : list, optional
            List of wall boundary points. If omitted, the limiter is used as the
            wall.
        magnetic_probe_data : dict, optional
            Dictionary containing magnetic probe descriptions.
        active_coils_path : str, optional

        refine_mode : str, optional
            Refinement mode for extended passive structures. Defaults to ``"G"``.
        preserve_currents : bool, optional
            If True, currents for labels that are present in both the old and new
